# Introduction to JavaScript

What is JavaScript? HTML and CSS allow us to lay out a web page structurally and visually. We can even add forms, buttons, and links to other pages. Normally, these elements lead to a new page.

JavaScript is a programming language that lets us add interactive pieces to our page. It's a full programming language like any other, allowing you to change the page in real time, add effects, and even make applications and games.

## How Browsers Work

Your browser is a full rendering and graphics engine. Every time you do something with your mouse, keyboard, or with JavaScript, it gives both the browser and your code information that something has happened. This is called an event, and browsers exist in a lifecycle of events and responses.

This is a very simple view, and it's a very deep topic, but this power allows you to do anything with JavaScript. 3D modeling, art programs, games, engineering applications, and even social media sites like Facebook all use this language to create a very interactive experience.

## Exercises
1. Change the duration of the setInterval from 1000 to 100. What happens? Try setting it to 10.
2. Try changing the text of the `alert`. Move it outside of the block it's in and refresh the page. What happens? This block is called a `function` in JavaScript.
3. Add a click event to your article with a button called "Remove Image". Make it remove the image using the `removeChild()` function.
4. We added a way to create a new fact. Now add a way to create a new thing to do.
