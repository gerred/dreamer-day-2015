# Making an Article

So far, we've made a pretty simple site. Even though it displays properly, we should help the browser decide how our site should be displayed. This will make it appear properly in other browsers, in other countries, in other languages, and on other devices like phones and tablets.

## Exercises

In this exercise, you'll make your own article. With your partner, make a page about both of you, include a picture each of your favorite animal, and add a few facts about yourself.
