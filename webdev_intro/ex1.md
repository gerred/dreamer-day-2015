# Your First Web Site

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is one of the languages of the web. It provides everything a browser needs to know about how your page is structured. Let's build our first web site.

## Exercises

1. In CodePen, press the "Play" button on top. This lets you start writing your own code. If you get lost at any time, press the "Catch Up" button or ask for help.
2. Inside the `<h1>` tag, change the text. What happens?
3. Do the same with the p tag. Add multiple lines.
4. Create a new header in our page. This is called a tag. Try making an h2 tag, under the h1 tag, and add some content. Keep trying this all the way down to h6. What happens when you try making an h7? Why?
5. Within the p tag, try adding the following code: `<strong>HTML is a lot of fun!</strong>`. What happens?
6. Try adding another list, more list items, or more paragraph tags. Spend some time playing around.
7. If you want to save your page, press the "Fork" button to make a copy. You will have to sign up, but this will let you access your pages later. All exercises can be forked.
8. When you're done, press "Catch Up" to return to the class.
