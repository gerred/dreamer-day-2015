# Adding More Animals

Right now, we have a pretty simple, but working game. We can make the game harder by adding some rules. For this game, we're going to add the rest of our animals: a panda, parrot, and penguin.

## Exercises

1. Make each animal give a different score. What happens when you set an animal to a negative number?
2. Make each animal move and rotate at a different speed. Make some animals harder to catch than others.
3. Right now, all of the animals fall at about the same time. Remember how we made the monkey fall on a different part of the screen? Spread the other animals out in the same way.
