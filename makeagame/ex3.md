# Adding Interaction

Now we have falling animals. So far, this isn't much of a game, but we're getting much closer. Let's make things happen when we click on an animal.

## Exercises

1. When we click on an monkey, it disappears. Remove the code that does this, and have it do something else on click. Use the tint from our first exercise to change the color.
2. Set the velocity of the monkey on click so that it jumps.
3. Right now, it's pretty easy to catch the monkey. Try adding some rotation and increasing the gravity to make it harder or easier.
