# Movement and Physics

We now have a bunch of animals in our game. However, they don't really do anything right now. We will make them move, and talk about physics and add gravity.

## Exercises

1. Change the values of x and y when moving the sprite around. What happens? What if you set it to a really high number? What if you set it to a really low number?
2. Change the rotation angle in your update. What happens? What if you set it to a negative number?
3. With physics on, set the gravity to a really low number. Set the gravity to a really high number. What happens?
