# Making it a Game

Now we have a falling monkey that we can click on. This isn't really a game, though. Let's make the monkey fall from the sky, and start counting how many monkeys we can catch!

## Exercises

1. We've added a score. Try changing the score. What if monkeys gave 1 point and pandas gave 10 points? What if catching a parrot lost 5 points?
2. What happens if an animal falls off of the screen? Right now we get rid of it. Drop the score by 1 for every missed animal.
3. Spend some time playing with your game. Change what animal we're using.
