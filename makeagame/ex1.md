# Introduction to Games

Making games is very different from other types of programming. It's a very creative exercise. With JavaScript, we can make games in the browser that you can make and test very rapidly.

In these exercises, we will be using a game engine called [phaser.io](http://http://phaser.io/).

## Exercises

1. Change the X and Y values of the sprite. Move it across the screen.
2. Change the scale of the sprite. What happens?
3. We've added the monkey. Add a few more sprites and put them in different places on the screen.
4. Try changing the tint of the monkey, and of the other animals.
5. Use `this.monkey.angle = 20` to rotate the monkey. Try rotating the other animals.
6. Our monkey is right now rotating on the top left corner. Use `this.monkey.anchor.setTo(0.5, 0.5)` to rotate it on the center. Try this on the other animals.
